                <div class="description">Able to entering Fine Art for diploma was a surprise to me back in Oct 2020 for I never once imagined myself pursuing arts thanks to people perception towards it. But I went for it as no matter where I looked, seems like only arts fits my passion. Up until know, I would do it again if I were given a chance to go back in time.
                    Entering Diploma challenges my introvert self to explore and make the most of my times here with getting to know people, sharing interests and passions. College of Creative Arts is a small faculty that makes it easy for me to gain experiences by learning and upskill in arts.
                    Fine Arts also brings my love for culture especially when it comes to Sarawak. I feels it is important to learn at least one or two things about culture as the works might fading away in the modern world.</div>

                <div class="description">My highschool years were filled with prefects duties - that “partially made who I am today”. Being a prefect at a school where I knows nobody in Form 1, helps me navigating my highschool life although with twists that differs my experience when compared to my peers (as small as learning to use Microsoft software effectively :| ).
                    SMK Tun Abang Haji Openg was where I met Fathin Fatihah! Being classmates since 2017, got closer since 2019 to being roomates in UiTM felt like destiny as both of us nailed SPM together and got to the same university. It feels like a reward to have such a good friend that feels like a sister.</div>

                <div class="date">2023-2024</div>
                <div class="description">Being a president was a huge news to me when I was first appointed by the seniors. It felt surreal although we were a small club with a few members in. But just like prefects, presidency is one-of-a-kind experience that I won’t think I would find anywhere else.”
                    It was scary at first when you were given a responsibility without a proper guide on the hows’ and whys’. Yet I believes I could finish it with the help of the rest of the members. I emphasized on the importance of togetherness, communication, and collaborations when working with lots of people. Although sometimes faces failures, I would tried to see it as a setback that only made me stronger and wiser in leading the community. I feels so grateful to be working with a very supportive group of people surrounds me that too, are hoping for the best in terms of the club’s future. Without them, managing FIASO would be impossible. Having a good collaboration with GRADES brings much more memorable experiences I could asked for as another club under the College of Creative Arts.</div>

                <div class="date">2024</div>
                <div class="description">In May 2024, I had been chosen as one of the delegates for the exhibition located in Jakarta, Indonesia under SSSPU with another ten students of the best out of best. The trip centered around organising an international art exhibition, in which I can say was one of my long awaited chance. 
                    The experiences I gained was absolute gem as it feels like a lifetime although it was just a four days trip. The knowledge I received and the new friends I made was a prized memory I will keep in my mind. At first, the offer felt out of reach as someone coming from a middle class income family to travel oversea. Hesitated at first, I kept on saving up my savings with an uncertain feelings until the news were confirmed and our flights were covered.
                    Being an Indo songs listener, arriving in Jakarta felt like living in the music video where the difference between cultures, language, and even the time excites me. It was truly an unbelievable things in the year of 2024. My favorite moments was when we were visiting Universitas Trisakti during the exhibition day. </div>
