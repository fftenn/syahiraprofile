            For me, my life has been an eventful since my high school years including personal growth and academic goals when talking about life and achievements. Born in 9th February 2004 as the third child out of four, I have experienced moving out during her childhood from Bintulu to Kuching in 2013 as a fresh start following my father’s work.

            Growing up, I always find herself surrounded by arts and crafts than numbers and puzzles. My hobbies always ended up with her hands stained, glue ran out, or nagged by my mother for the mess I made but all in all, my mother would always encourage my colourful world - by helping with my PSV homeworks! Although there are talks about where I would go in her 20's being in the art scene.

            In my free time, you will find me scribbling down on papers, making junk journal, watching 2000's slice of life movies, or simply jamming to Indo/ Malay indie bands. I loves mingle around people but more preferred to enjoy things alone, in my own bubble. I am a reserved person even to my close friends, although it is pretty hard to notice. Yet, I loves hearing people sharing about their days to me for I believes everyone is their own main character.
